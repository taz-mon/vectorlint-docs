## Voice and tone

- Write in active voice. Never use passive constructions.
- Use present tense throughout.
- Address the reader as "you." Do not use "the user," "the developer," or "one."
- Do not call any step or feature "simple," "easy," "straightforward," or "just."
- Do not use marketing language, superlatives, or exclamation marks.
- Do not use filler phrases: "please note," "at this time," "it is worth mentioning."
- Do not use weasel words when the correct answer is known: "might," "could," "generally," "typically."
- Do not attribute motivations or feelings to software. Systems execute; they do not think, want, or know.
- Do not use "execute" to refer to using software. Use "run," "deploy," or "instantiate" depending on the context.
- Contractions are acceptable and preferred when they sound natural.

## Structure

- Every page must open with a short description (1–2 sentences) stating what the page covers and who it is for.
- Do not duplicate the page title in the short description.
- Use sentence case for all headings. Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns.
- Do not end headings with punctuation.
- Do not skip heading levels.
- Do not stack two headings with no body content between them.
- Start procedure headings with an imperative verb, not a gerund.

## Lists

- Introduce every list with a complete sentence ending in a colon.
- Do not let a list complete a sentence that begins above it.
- All items in a list must follow parallel grammatical structure.
- Do not create a list with fewer than two items. Use prose instead.
- Do not nest lists more than two levels deep.

## Procedures

- Use numbered steps for sequential tasks.
- Write one action per step.
- Start each step with an imperative verb.
- List prerequisites before step one under a "Before you begin" or "Prerequisites" heading.
- Include a verification step when the outcome is not visually obvious.

## Code and technical content

- Put every command the reader must type in a code block, not inline prose.
- Include a language identifier on every fenced code block.
- Format command names, file names, and parameter names as inline code.
- Format UI element names in bold, not inline code.
- Use `<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>` format for values the reader must replace.
- Explain every placeholder immediately after the code block.

## Language

- Define every acronym on first use: full term, then acronym in parentheses.
- After first use, use the acronym consistently. Do not alternate.
- Do not use "e.g.," "i.e.," or "etc." Use "for example," "that is," and "and so on."
- Spell out numbers zero through nine. Use numerals for 10 and above.
- Always use numerals for measurements, versions, and technical values.

## Terminology

- Use one term per concept. Do not introduce synonyms to avoid repetition.
- Use the official name of a product exactly as the project spells and capitalizes it.

## Admonitions

- Use admonitions sparingly. Do not use more than one per section.
- Keep admonition content to one or two sentences.
- Do not begin admonition content with the admonition type label ("Note:", "Warning:").
- Use Warning only for risks of data loss, system failure, or security vulnerability.
- Use Tip only for optional techniques. Do not put required steps in a Tip.
